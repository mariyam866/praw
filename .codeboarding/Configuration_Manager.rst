Details
-------

The PRAW library's core architecture is centered around two main components: the Configuration Manager and the Reddit API Client. The Configuration Manager, implemented by the praw.config.Config class, is responsible for abstracting and providing all necessary configuration settings, such as API credentials and user agent information, which can be sourced from praw.ini files or environment variables. This ensures a flexible and centralized approach to managing application settings. The Reddit API Client, represented by the praw.Reddit.Reddit class, serves as the primary interface for interacting with the Reddit API. It critically depends on the Configuration Manager to obtain its initialization parameters, enabling it to establish authenticated sessions and facilitate all subsequent API requests. This clear separation of concerns allows for robust configuration handling and a streamlined API interaction experience.

Configuration Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Expand <Configuration_Manager>`

This component is responsible for centralizing the loading, parsing, and provision of PRAW's configuration settings. It abstracts the underlying storage mechanisms (e.g., praw.ini file, environment variables) and offers a unified interface for retrieving critical API access parameters such as client ID, client secret, user agent, and redirect URI. These parameters are fundamental for establishing a connection and authenticating with the Reddit API.

* praw.config.Config

Reddit API Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the main API client, this component serves as the primary interface for all interactions with the Reddit API. It requires the configuration parameters managed by the Configuration Manager to initialize itself, authenticate, and make requests. It acts as the entry point for developers to access various Reddit resources and functionalities.

Details
-------

The PRAW library's core architecture is built around three central components: the `Configuration Manager`, the `High-Level API Interface`, and the `Authentication Module`. The `Configuration Manager` acts as the foundational layer, centralizing and providing all necessary configuration settings, including API credentials and user agent strings, to other components. The `High-Level API Interface` serves as the primary entry point for users, orchestrating API requests and relying on the `Configuration Manager` for initial setup. Crucially, the `Authentication Module` handles secure interactions with the Reddit API by managing OAuth2 flows, acquiring and refreshing access tokens, and utilizing credentials supplied by the `Configuration Manager`. This modular design ensures a clear separation of concerns, promoting maintainability and robust interaction with the Reddit API.

Configuration Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Expand <Configuration_Manager>`

This is the core component responsible for loading, parsing, and validating configuration settings for PRAW. It sources settings from various locations, including `praw.ini` files and environment variables, and provides a unified, structured interface for other parts of the library to access critical values such as API credentials, user agent strings, and other operational parameters. It also handles the application of default values when specific settings are not provided. This component is fundamental as it centralizes all configurable parameters, ensuring consistent and correct behavior across the API client.

High-Level API Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component represents the primary entry point for users to interact with the Reddit API. It encapsulates the overall client functionality and orchestrates API requests. It relies on the `Configuration Manager` to initialize itself with necessary settings like the user agent and other API-specific parameters, ensuring the client is properly configured before making any calls.

* `praw.reddit.Reddit:57-901 <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/reddit.py#L57-L901>`_

Authentication Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This conceptual component is responsible for handling the authentication process with the Reddit API, typically involving OAuth2 flows. It manages the acquisition, storage, and refreshing of access tokens and utilizes credentials (e.g., `client_id`, `client_secret`) provided by the `Configuration Manager` to establish authenticated sessions. This module is critical for securing API interactions.

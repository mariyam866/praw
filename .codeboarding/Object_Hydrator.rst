Details
-------

The PRAW library's core functionality revolves around three main components: praw.Reddit (API Client), Objector, and PRAW Data Models. The praw.Reddit (API Client) serves as the primary interface for making requests to the Reddit API and receiving raw JSON responses. These raw responses are then passed to the Objector, which acts as a central factory and dispatcher. The Objector is responsible for parsing the JSON data, handling any API errors, and transforming the raw data into rich, interactive PRAW Data Models. These data models, such as Submission, Comment, and Redditor, encapsulate Reddit resources and provide a Pythonic way to interact with them, abstracting the underlying API complexities. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the API client handling communication, the Objector managing data hydration, and the data models representing the structured Reddit resources.

Objector
^^^^^^^^

The core component of the hydration process. It acts as a factory and dispatcher, orchestrating the conversion of raw JSON data from the Reddit API into rich PRAW model objects. It also handles error detection and parsing within the API response.

praw.Reddit (API Client)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component represents the main entry point for interacting with the Reddit API. It is responsible for making HTTP requests, receiving raw JSON responses, and then delegating the processing of these responses to the Objector to convert them into PRAW models.

**Related Classes/Methods**:

* `praw.Reddit <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/__init__.py>`_

PRAW Data Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are the rich, interactive Python objects that represent various Reddit resources (e.g., submissions, comments, users). They encapsulate the data and provide methods for interacting with those resources in a Pythonic way, abstracting the underlying API calls.

  "description": "The PRAW `reddit.models` subsystem provides a structured object-oriented interface for interacting with the Reddit API. Core components like `Submission`, `Comment`, `Redditor`, and `Subreddit` serve as primary data models, encapsulating Reddit entities and their associated functionalities. These core models are augmented by specialized moderation components (`SubmissionModeration`, `CommentModeration`, `SubredditModeration`) that provide administrative capabilities, and stream components (`RedditorStream`) for accessing dynamic content. The system is designed around clear object relationships, where entities like `Subreddit` contain `Submission`s, and `Submission`s contain `Comment`s, facilitating intuitive navigation and interaction with Reddit data. Moderation components act directly upon their respective core entities, enabling a clear separation of concerns between data representation and administrative actions.",

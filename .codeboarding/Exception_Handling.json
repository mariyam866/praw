  "description": "The PRAW error handling subsystem efficiently processes raw API responses into structured, actionable exceptions. The `ErrorDetector` initiates the process by identifying potential errors in API responses, subsequently delegating their detailed parsing to the `ExceptionFactory`. The `ExceptionFactory` then leverages the `ErrorParser` to transform raw error data into standardized `ErrorItem` objects. Finally, based on these structured error details, the `ExceptionFactory` constructs and raises appropriate custom exceptions, all derived from the foundational `ExceptionBase`, providing a consistent and predictable error interface for developers.",
